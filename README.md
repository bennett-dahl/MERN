# MERN

This is my final product after going through this course on udemy: https://www.udemy.com/course/mern-stack-front-to-back/

Highly recommended for MERN stack understanding. I would recommend you take the crash courses Brad Traversy has on TraversyMedia on you tube for React, MongoDB, and Node.JS first!
